# git shareware-init (demo concept)

This repo demonstrates a proposed pattern for protecting
"golden builds" from accidental edits (human or AI).

- `shareware.yml` = manifest of canonical versions
- `/archive/` = protected builds
- `/lab/` = .gitignored sandbox
- `/launcher/` = retro shareware-style launcher UI

This is not a real game, just a structure demo.
