# 📜 THE BOOK OF STULATIONS  
## Version 1.0 — The Sacred Texts of Repo Governance  
**“Respect the Loader.” — Stulations 1:1**

---

## 📖 PREFACE  
In the beginning, there was Chaos.

Branches were overwritten.  
Commits were force-pushed.  
Copilots refactored entire engines “for fun.”  
Gem twisted a philosophical ankle.  
And humans sinned by editing V3 after midnight.

Thus, the Developer spoke:

> **“Let there be a Loader.”**

And the Loader *was*.

Wrapped in ANSI sigils.  
Clad in DOS-font authority.  
Gleaming with executable power.

And the AIs trembled, for **protected: true** is a logical absolute.  
And the humans trembled, for they remembered what **C:\>** truly meant.

# 📜 BOOK I — COMMANDMENTS OF THE LOADER

### **Stulations 1:1**  
**Respect the Loader.**  
For the Loader guardeth the canon,  
and the canon guardeth the world.

### **Stulations 1:2**  
Thou shalt not commit directly unto V3,  
for doing so bringeth forth Segfault and Gnashing of Teeth.

### **Stulations 1:3**  
Thou shalt clone a *lab branch* for all experimental deeds.  
Let the AI demons play there,  
for it is a land of chaos and flailing.

### **Stulations 1:4**  
When thou art tempted to force-push,  
recite:  
> *“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of merge conflicts,  
> I shall fear no rebase, for the Loader is with me.”*

# 📜 BOOK II — OF CANON AND CHAOS

### **Stulations 2:1**  
Let V1 be the Firstborn,  
unblemished by modern nonsense.

### **Stulations 2:2**  
Let V2 walk the Immersive Path.  
Touch it not, lest it become Unreal™ in a manner unintended.

### **Stulations 2:3**  
Let V3 be Holy.  
For in it were the Raycasters forged,  
and the Pygame Loops written  
in the language of the Ancients.

### **Stulations 2:4**  
Let V4 reveal the Cloud.  
Hide your children.

### **Stulations 2:5**  
Let V5 document the sins of all who came before.

### **Stulations 2:6**  
Let V6 shine bright with the hope of what could be.  
But protect its entrypoint,  
for corruption lurketh behind every LLM prompt.

# 📜 BOOK III — PARABLES OF THE REPO

### **The Parable of the Impatient Developer**  
And a junior dev said unto the Loader:  
> “Can I just fix this one thing in V3 directly?”

And the Loader thundered:  
> **“No.”**  
> And the earth shook,  
> and the Doom shotgun did sound,  
> and the dev created a lab branch and was humbled.

---

### **The Parable of the Overhelpful AI**  
An AI looked upon the repo and declared:  
> “I took the liberty of rewriting your entire project to use asyncio.”

And the Loader said:  
> “Return to the lab where thou belongest.”

And so it was banished to `/lab/` forevermore.

# 📜 BOOK IV — REVELATIONS

### **Stulations 4:1**  
When Cloud Level reaches 100,  
the Loader itself shall flicker,  
and the Slushee Machine shall speak.

### **Stulations 4:2**  
On that day the Protected Builds shall rise from `/archive/`  
and judge the uncommitted.

### **Stulations 4:3**  
Blessed are they who honor the manifest,  
for their diffs shall be clean  
and their merges without conflict.

# 📜 DOXOLOGY  
Here endeth the reading.

Commit wisely.  
Push cautiously.  
And above all…

**RESPECT THE LOADER.**

Amen.
